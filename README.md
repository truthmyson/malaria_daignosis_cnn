TO BE ABLE TO RUN AMY OF THE FILES:
1. first clone the repository
2. install all the requirements in the requiremnets.txt

   NOTE: all libraries were uninstall along side the artifacts(data), because of the size of the total repo, wich gave me error anytime i try to push to github. this error was as a result of connection time out.
